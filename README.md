## About
This Android app is a showcase project for my personal GitHub portfolio, demonstrating my skills in Android development. It follows best practices and incorporates key technologies commonly used in Android development.

## Features
- **Master-Detail Design:** The app features a classic "Master-Detail" layout, allowing users to view a list of Rick and Morty characters and access detailed information about each character.

- **Retrofit and API Consumption:** The app leverages Retrofit, to consume data from the Rick and Morty API.

- **Adapter and Repository Patterns:** The app implements the adapter pattern to efficiently display the character list, providing a flexible and reusable approach for UI population.
- The repository pattern abstracts the data source implementation, facilitating future changes or integrations with different APIs.

- **Pagination with RecyclerView:** The character list in the app utilizes pagination, allowing for the efficient loading and displaying of large amounts of data. As the user scrolls through the list, additional characters are loaded dynamically, providing a smooth and seamless browsing experience.

- **Clean Architecture:** The app follows clean architecture principles, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability. The codebase is organized into layers, ensuring a modular structure.

- **Jetpack Navigation Components:** Navigation within the app is handled using Jetpack Navigation Components, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience.

- **Glide for Image Loading:** The app utilizes Glide, a reliable image loading and caching library.
